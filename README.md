# Console Chat with Python

## Description

This project implements a basic console chat system that allows communication between two clients through a server, using Python and sockets. The server acts as an intermediary, receiving messages from one client and forwarding them to the other, thus enabling bidirectional real-time communication within the same network.

## Features

- **Real-Time Communication:** Messages are sent and received in real-time between clients.
- **Support for Multiple Clients:** Although primarily designed for two clients, the server can be easily adapted to support multiple connections.
- **Ease of Use:** Simple console user interface for easy interaction.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Ability to configure the server's IP address and port for execution in different network environments.

## Requirements

Python 3.6 or higher.

## Usage

To use this chat system, you'll need to start both the server and the clients.
